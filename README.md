# MyProjectApplication
The salon’s booking management has been run in an old-fashioned way for several years, the employees write the booking information on a diary which is be time consuming and inefficient since they won’t be able to answer all calls when they are busy which makes them lose customers. It also effects the customer experience since the hairstylist won’t be able to give the customer full attention at their appointment when the phone rings. The salon has also experienced that a few customers don’t attending their appointment without canceling their appointment. 

The motivation for the salon-booking application is to make it easier for the salon to manage their bookings, where the customer will be able to book and cancel appointments. The application will also have be able to display the salons offers and prices, in overall improve the customer/user experience.
